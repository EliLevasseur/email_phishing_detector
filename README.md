# ðŸ§  Can Python Detect a Phishing Email?

### Overview
This is a 10-day beginner Python case study exploring how simple text analysis can detect phishing emails.  
The goal: go from a rule-based keyword detector â†’ to a basic trained model by the end.

### Tools
- Python 3  
- pandas (data exploration)  
- matplotlib (visualization)  
- scikit-learn (for final ML model)

### ðŸ“ˆ Progress Log
- **Day 1:** Set up project, wrote README, made starter dataset, tested environment.  
- **Day 2:** Expanded dataset to 24 rows, loaded it with pandas, explored phishing vs legit text length.  

---

### ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Count top phishing keywords.  
- Visualize results with matplotlib.  
- Start building detection logic.
